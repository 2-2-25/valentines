            <p>Dear Kane,<br><br>

                Happy Valentine's day! It’s funny, because before we confessed, I thought about whether or not I should/could wish you a happy Valentine’s day, because yk, that’s what perfectly platonic besties do and not anything else ^.^
                <br><br>
                Wanted to remind you that I really care about you, or in your words, I’m fond of you. This will never not be funny to me but it’s also a moment that’s really dear to me, so BIG WIN FOR THE VI COMMUNITY
                <br><br>
                I can’t believe we’ve known each other for around 3 years!! We’ve really seen each other in so many different phases and periods in our life, and I’m so glad that we decided to stay in touch because look where we are now. Can’t believe it took so long for us to figure out feelings and communicate though. Worst slow burn ever 1 star the characters AND plot weren’t even realistic, characters were insufferable and annoying. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone ugh
                <br><br>
                Hope you’re keeping up with the yappage you set yourself up for this LMAO
                <br><br>
                It makes me sad that our relationship couldn’t have happened in real life. I wish I could hear your laugh, I wish we could go skiing or snowboarding together, and I wish we could enjoy some peace, quiet and just each other’s presence. Either way, I’ve still found ways to love you regardless. I like the way you care so much about your family and loved ones, I like your stupid sense of humour, your homophobic dog eyes and slightly scared/sad demeanour (as YOU call it ok don't look at me man), and I like hearing your opinions on all sorts of topics and matters. I like learning about you as a person, and all the really funny jokes you make. I like the you that perseveres through anything regardless of what happens. I like how you remember so many of the details that I’ve seen to have forgotten. I like how you always try and return the favour, and go out of your way to help the people you love. I like that I can be honest with you and that I don’t feel regret after being vulnerable.
                <br><br>
                Talking to you really is so special to me, and I don’t have anyone else who I can talk to in the way that we do. I wish we could be teenagers and get through our last year of high school together, but if through text is the only way it can happen for now, then I’d go through that for us
                <br><br>
                You make me want to be a better person and the motivation has helped me ever since we started talking again, and I hope I do the same for you. I like that our conversations can fluctuate from serious topics to joking around without feeling unnatural. Everything feels just right.
                <br><br>
                It feels like the world has treated you so unfairly at times and it makes me feel helpless whenever I can’t help. I can only hope that the world will be kinder to you going forward and that I can help by making the future something to look forward to.
                <br><br>
                FINALLY SHE’S DONE YAPPING!! God I thought it’d never end but that’s all I have to say for Valentine’s. The nurses are catching up and omg omg THEYRE HERE KANE THEYRE GRABBING ME WAIT KANE BEFORE I GO I
                <br><br>
                Jokes aside, happy Valentine’s Kane. Hope this wasn’t too much to read (I say knowing damn well I wrote a page's worth of paragraphs). Love you, take care =)
