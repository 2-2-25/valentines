                <br><br>They're pins I saved because I thought they were kind of us or reminded me of you. I've sent some of them to you I think, but there are a lot of ones that I was too shy to send or didn't bc we were just friends at the time LOL

                <br><br> Have fun digging through them there's a bunch
